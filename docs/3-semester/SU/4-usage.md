# Usage

***Actor:*** *An abstraction of users or other systems that interact with the target system*

***Use Case:*** *A pattern for interaction between the system and actors in the application domain*



Involve the user,  by presenting use cases through prototypes.

To illustrate relations between actors and use-cases you can use either **action table** or **use case diagrams**. UML recommends use-case diagrams, while the book prefers actor table (because of space).

**Actor table example for automatic payment system:**

## Find Actors and Use Cases

<center>
Who will use the system?
<br>
How will it be used?

If several roles appear the same to the system, consider consolidating them into one.



### Actor Specifications

The target system’s actors described in specifications.

Consists of 3 parts: goal, characteristics, and examples.

Describes (as precisely as possible) the actor’s role in relation to the target system.

### Use Case Specification | Statechart Diagram

Use case specification is more detailed than statechart diagram - Should not contain unnecessary details thought!
