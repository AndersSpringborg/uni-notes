# Classes and Objects

**Class:**

A description of a collection of objects sharing: structure, behavioral pattern, and attributes.

**Object:**

An entity with identity, state, and behavior.



**Relation:**

An object is created from the description of a class.
An object belongs to a class (from which it was created).
Each class contains a set of objects; we refer to them as the objects of the class.
