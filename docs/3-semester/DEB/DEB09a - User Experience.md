Recall the definition of Usability in Lecture 07.

**User Experience:**

From ISO 9241-210

> A person's **perceptions** and **responses** that result from the use or anticipated use of a product, system or service...

This is a broader term than usability.

**Emotion is a key aspect!**

Purely aesthetics.

### Pitfalls?

What does the participant remember most from the interaction?

If he had a bad interaction in the end, is this what is reflected in the questionnaire?

Or is it the mean of the whole interaction? 



## Emotions

**What are emotions?**

James-Lange (1884):

* "... the result of physical changes in autonomic and motor functions"
* Sensory input creates bodily responses
* Awareness of bodily changes constitutes an emotion.

Scherer (2005):

* Mobilization and synchronization of organismic subsystems
* A response to a cognitive evaluation of stimulus events
* Events are "of major concerns for the organism"



**Moods/Attitudes vs. Emotions (Scherer, 2005)**

* Emotions are intense and short-lived (connected to specific events)
* Moods are of low intensity and may last for days



**6 Basic Emotions**

**Emotion Graph**

### How can we measure emotions?

#### **Self-Assessment-Manikin (SAM)**

![1547651050799](images/1547651050799.png)

Studies show that when we evaluate emotions in retrospect, the major movements in emotions will dominate.

- If one really cool thing makes us happy, this will dominate the evaluation



#### **Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)**

Used during the interactions

* Use the graph data to pick points of interests.
* Show the user video clips of the POI's
* Ask them to reflect on what happens
