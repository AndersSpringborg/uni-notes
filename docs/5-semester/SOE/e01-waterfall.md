## SE Process Activities

Four fundamental software engineering activities

1. **Software specification**

    * The functionality of the software and constraints on its operation must be defined

2. **Software development**

    * The software to meet the specification must be produced

3. **Software Validation**

    * The software must be validated to ensure that it does what the customer wants
    * Validation:
        * Are we building the right systems?
        * Conforms to customers' expectations and experience
    * Verification
        * Are we building the system right?
        * Conforms to specification
    * Techniques:
        * <u>Testing</u> of programs and prototypes
        * <u>Reviewing</u> of specifications, documentation and programs
    * Stages of testing
        * Component testing $\to$ System testing $\to$ Customer testing

4. **Software evolution**

    * The software must evolve to meet changing customer needs

## Software Process Models

1. **Waterfall Model **(Plan-driven)

    * Seperate and distinct phases of specification, design, implementation, test, and operations

2. **Incremental Model** (Plan-driven, agile or mix)

    * Specification, development and validation are interleaved.
    * System is developed as a series of versions (increments), with each version adding functionality to the previous version.

3. **Integration & configurations model** (Reuse)

    * System is assembled from existing configurable components.
    * Plan-driven or agile
    *
