# Language Design and Control Structures

* Language Design Criteria
* Evaluation of expressions
* Explicit sequence control vs. structured sequence control
* Loop constructs
* Subprograms
* Parameter mechanisms



## Tennent's Language Design Principles

**The Principle of Abstraction**

* All major syntactic categories should have abstractions defined over them.
    For example, functions are abstractions over expressions.

**The Principle of Correspondence**

* Declarations $\approx$ Parameters

**The Principle of Data Type Completeness**

* All data types should be first class without arbitrary restriction on their use



\- Originally defined by R.D.Tennent



### Abstraction

Nearly all programming languages support **process (or command) abstractions** with subprograms (procedures)

Many programming languages support **expression abstraction** with functions.

Nearly all programming languages designed since 1980 have supported **data abstraction**

* Abstract data types
* Objects
* Modules
